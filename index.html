                        In this project we are going to manipulate a dataset called best selling artists ever which is provided as a csv file. The last of column named 
                        years_active is one of the columns I added using python to have a more completed dataset. This dataset is an unstructured dataset which means
                        we can visualize two meaningless charts at most using just those columns. That is to say, we need many manipulations and text analysis to 
                        make that data usable in a way we want. This dataset includes ranges of numbers in a string format or also different important data all in string format 
                        next to each other without any specific pattern which makes the dataset challenging to work with.  
                         The following list of best-selling music artists includes those music acts from the 20th century to the present with claims of 
                         75 million or more record sales worldwide.

                    This chart concerns the number of sales for singers and we can show 10,
                     20 or 50 of them at the same time while choosing among the ones have worked upto 
                    10 years,20 years or 50 years. The beatles has the highest sales among the other
                     four singers with 601M sales in 10 years. The sale for this singer is at peak
                    with a high difference compared to the other four singers. Also, The doors has sold out for 75M in 8 years which has a
                     high difference compared to the other remaining singers and the rest have sold close to one another.

                    In this dataset, there are only five singers who have sold out more than 75M with 
                    active years of less than or equal to 10 years. 
                    When it comes to working for upto 20 years, Led Zeppelin, Rihanna and Taylor swift comes in as some other high seller artists but again,
                    they lose in the competition. But when we try to visualize best sellers working upto 50 years. Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson are great competators 
                    with 500M and 300M sales with thr working years of 23 and 45 years accordingly. Another interesting fact here is that although led Zeppelin
                    has worked for 12 years, they sold out the same as madonna who has a working-period of 44 years. A considerable conclusion for this visualization would 
                    be the fact that it does not matter how many songs the bands or singers publish, if those songs become popular, they can beat the records as
                    the highest number sales belong to one of the bands with the least number of years being active.

                    One of the concepts in music industry is the TCU phenomenon. TCU is an abbreviation for Total Certified Units. This concept has emerged in the USA. 
                    it includes the number of streams and the number of plays on different platforms. Anyway, The dataset does not give a specific information on that 
                    and it seems it can have other parameters too. By the way, this specifies some certifications given by a relevant governing body. These certifications are 
                    given when a certain number of units have been sold, streamed, or downloaded,and they serve as a measure of an artist's commercial success.  
                    As a matter of fact,  Anyway, it is better to have some comparisons between each artist's sales and TCU 
                    to see does necessarily an artist with higher sales, have higher TCU too or not. According to my findings, If a singer or a band has more number of sales,
                    does not mean it has the highest number of TCUs too. Although Drake is 20th of the list in terms of sales, it has the highest TCU. On the other hand, 
                    The Beatles who has beaten a record in terms of sales, has a high number of TCU but not more than Drake and some other artists 
                    who have lower rankings in terms of sales. The other interesting result is that there are some major differenes in TCU among artists with the same number of 
                    sales . A good example would be Rihanna and Pink Floyed. Rihanna with 335 number of TCUs has much higher TCU than Pink Floyed. Eminem, Rihanna and Drake have 
                    the top TCUs, which means they have more commercial success. As a conclusion we can say that TCU and the number of sales have a positive correlation and are 
                    usually close,but we cannot say that the higher the number of sales is, the TCU is higher too.

                            a measure of TCU through the radius of bubbles . Each bubble is a singer. The color also shows the nationality of the singer. 
                            What we have found is the highest number of singers in this dataset belongs to the united states. We understand this when we hover on 
                            its bubble out of the box and the next one belongs to United Kingdom. While we expect the number of years increases the chance of having higher
                            sales and TCUs, we observe the number of TCUs is at top for singers who have worked approximately 20 years and the number of sales does
                            not necessarily escalate with a passage of time. But in some cases like Mickeal Jackson and Queen on the contrary, an eye-catching 
                            increase is observable.

                            In this chart we want to see which genres have been included in the singers' work. This pie chart shows that Among all genres,
                             pop is the most popular one with 22% of popularity and the next one with a high difference is rock with 13.81 %. 
                             If we choose 50 genres to show, psychedelic rock is the least popular genre among singers. This does not only show the singer's interest 
                             although there are not data related to people's interest. We can somehow say that these genres are popular among the singers because they are popular
                             among people too. We can use the most popular genres in the next visualization too. The most challenging part here was the extraction of genres of each
                             singer. They must be extracted and then put in a dictionary and using an algorithm written by me, the mentioned task was done. Then they should be counted
                             as a dictionary comprises of a key and a value. The key here was the name of the genre and the value was the number of times it has been met in the dataset.
                             Using the total number of occurences of all genres, we can calculate the percentage of inclusion of each genre in the all over of the dataset.

                                       As we can see the united dtates is on top in all of the genres and singers exploiting those genres are from there. 
                                       R&B has the most popularity with 88% in the USA and then hip hop with 80%.
                                       United Kingdom is the next country in which the singers with the genres of pop, rock and hard rock are born the most.
                                       Canada percentage is scattered among four genres of pop, rock, R&B and hip hop with percentages of less than 9.
                                       Barbados is also seen in three genres of pop, R&B and hip hop. The rest are united states and united kingdom in rock and trinidad and
